# 🩺 U.S. Medical Insurance Costs – Python Analysis

This project explores real-world U.S. medical insurance data using Python and pandas to investigate trends, correlations, and cost differences based on demographics and lifestyle factors. The dataset includes variables such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, region, and insurance charges.
