# 🩺 U.S. Medical Insurance Costs – Python Analysis

This project explores real-world U.S. medical insurance data using Python and pandas to investigate trends, correlations, and cost differences based on demographics and lifestyle factors. The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance) and includes variables such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, region, and insurance charges.

## 📊 Project Goals

- Analyze the average age of patients in the dataset
- Compare medical charges between smokers and non-smokers
- Examine the correlation between BMI, number of children, and insurance costs
- Explore which regions have the highest representation
=======
- Analyze the average age of patients with at least one child
- Explore which regions have the highest representation
- Organize findings using JSON for reproducibility
- Practice Git, GitHub, branching, and collaborative workflows
